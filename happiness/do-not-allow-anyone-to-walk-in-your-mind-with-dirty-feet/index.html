            Do not allow anyone to walk in your mind with dirty feet	<span class="day">

        <p>It&rsquo;s true that our happiness lies in our hands or rather minds, but it&rsquo;s also true that we do base our happiness on the people around us. And, why not? ðŸ˜…</p>

        <p>We are after all human and are dependent on each other for so many things, so why not happiness? ðŸ«£</p>
        
        <p> Wise people say, &ldquo;The less you expect, the more you will be happy&rdquo;. And, it is true, but if we don&rsquo;t expect from our close ones then who?ðŸ¤”</p>
        
        <p> However, there are some people who inspire you and then there are some who drain you, pick them wisely. But again how?</p>
        
        <p> Picking people or cutting them from your life doesn&rsquo;t mean you stop keeping a relationship with them.</p>
        
        <p>It simply means that you love and respect yourself, and for your happiness and peace, you keep them at a distance, if not physically, then mentally and emotionally. ðŸ™‰ðŸ™ˆðŸ™Š</p>
        
        <p> Is this possible? Well, everything is if you put in the required effort.</p>
        
        <p>To start with, here are 3 simple efforts you can work on</p>
        
        <p>Pull back the amount of time, energy, or emotional availability you give them</p>
        
        <p>Keep your interactions to safe topics or activities</p>
        
        <p>Maintain your boundaries</p>

        <p> Life is short. Don&rsquo;t waste it on negative people who are inconsistent in their efforts for you. ðŸ“Œ</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>As Albert Einstein said, &ldquo;Stay away from negative people. They have a problem for every solution&rdquo;.</p>
        
        <p> Remember, you can be kind and still choose to walk away (mentally, emotionally, or physically) from toxic people.</p>
        
        <p>And then when you are around people who inspire you, you can base your happiness (a part of it) on them. ðŸ˜‰</p>
        
        <p> Have a happy weekend</p>
        
        <p> Love,</p>
        
        <p>Walkover</p>
