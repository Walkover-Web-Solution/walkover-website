        <p>There are different definitions of success for different people.<br><br>

            Some people base it on their<br>
            <strong>

                ‚úîÔ∏è Career success<br>
                ‚úîÔ∏è Acquired wealth<br>
                ‚úîÔ∏è Material possessions<br><br>
            </strong>

            While some base their sense of success on<br>

            <strong>

                ‚úîÔ∏è How they feel about themselves<br>
                ‚úîÔ∏è The strength of their relationships<br>
                ‚úîÔ∏è A life well-lived<br><br>
            </strong>

            In psychological terms, success can be defined as the 'achievement of intention'. Accomplishing whatever it
            is you set out to accomplish.<br><br>
            <strong>
                If you have accomplished more than half of these things in life, you're a successful person.

        It's true, that most of us define success with materialism, it is drilled into us by our older generations,
        marketing companies, and now social media. ü§ë<br>
        And, we are drilling the same definition into the minds of our coming generations. ü§î<br><br>
