			So visible yet so ignored

		<p>What do you call it <br>
           1.When nobody wakes you up in the morning <br>
		   2.Nobody waits for you at night <br>
		   3.You can do whatever you want <br>
		   <br>
		   Young people might call it freedom üíÉ but the elderly call it loneliness üò¢ <br>
		   <br>
		   <strong>They are not invisible to us, we see them, we meet them, we greet them and then we just get on with our busy livesüôè </strong> <br>
           <br>
           You might feel that you are giving enough time to your parents & grandparents and doing your best to lessen their loneliness, but for them, it isn‚Äôt enough? <br>
		   <br>
		   We are always talking about ourselves, today let‚Äôs talk about ways we can make our elderly feel special (it begins with keeping your phone aside) üì¥ <br>
		   1.<i>Enjoy a meal together- take them out or order in their favourite meal </i> <br>
		   2.<i>Ask them about themselves- what was their life like back then, their dreams, their happiness </i> <br>
		   3.<i>Encourage them to love themself- our elders have never had time for themselves so they‚Äôre still unaware of self-care </i> <br>
		   4.<i>Join a community- there are many groups for the elderly- library, laughing club, cards </i> <br>
		   5.<i>Listen to old songs together- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J29F_i5dS7I"><u> play their favourite songs</u></a> and ask them to sing along</i> <br>

			<strong>It‚Äôs important to make people in our life feel special-</strong> so what are you waiting for- go give your grand/parents a hug or just hang out with them for a bit or give them a head massage or <br>
			ask them to give you one. <br> 
			<br>
			<strong>Remember, everyone just wants to be wanted! ‚ù§</strong> <br>
			<br>
			Love <br>
