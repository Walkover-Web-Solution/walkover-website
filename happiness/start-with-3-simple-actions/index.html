            <span class="day">Fri, Nov 8</span>
        </h5>
        <p>Hola!<br>

            What happens when we find ourselves in a bad place - a looming deadline, lost baggage, stuck in an elevator
            - panic strikes, and instead of composing ourselves we complicate things by floundering.<br><br>

            Understand,<strong> we don't need a complex strategy when we're in a bad place. All we need is a spark of
                belief to
                think with a little more clarity. ü§ç </strong><br><br>

            Life is life, and it often presents us with people, ideas, and events that feel impossible to slide free
            from.<br><br>

            So what to do when you find yourself in a bad place?<br><br>

            <strong>1. BREATHE ü´Å</strong><br><br>

            Breathing seems so trivial at that moment. We breathe every moment of our life without giving it a second
            thought. So why care about it at that precise moment?<br><br>


            Because we breathe less when we are anxious. Our breathing becomes shallow and if you are to survive that
            panic moment you must break the cycle.<br><br>


            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9jbHCRq9Ho?feature=shared" target="_blank">Breathe now</a> - deep,
            mindful, happy
            breaths.<br><br>


            Just 5 deep breaths and your fear loses its edge, your mood uplifts, and you feel calmer. Practice taking
            5-10 deep breaths every day.<br><br>

            <strong>2. SWEAT üòÖ</strong><br><br>

            Include sweaty exercises in your training session to release all the toxins from your body.<br><br>


            Dance, jog, go in a sauna, do whatever works for you to sweat like a horse. It will help elevate your mind
            and mood making you feel healthier and happier.<br><br>

            Try it for a week or so.<br><br>

            <strong>3. MAKE A CHANGE ü´∞</strong><br><br>

            After you incorporate the above two actions in your daily life, focus on an area of your life that you have
            been meaning to work on.<br><br>


            Look inward to analyze whether it is your character or your circumstances that are holding you back.<br><br>

            Find the source of it and then figure out small consistent steps you can take to be a better version of
            yourself.<br><br>

            For the next fourteen days, incorporate atleast one small step towards your goal.
        </p>
